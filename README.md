Description:
This upscaler is designed for portrait photos, sharpening slightly blurred old pictures, restoring some details on the skin, and is particularly effective in restoring studio shots that have been significantly reduced in quality. 
This model was trained on the RGT network. I have tested it on initial restoration steps for Supir, and it has produced astonishing results.

I have used Supir for some results; Supir as a refiner helping to soften the sharpening.Supir helps create macro details for a more realistic effect. Using this workflow ensures that the results do not deviate significantly from the original image. 

I might train more and increase the sample size leaning towards content details on the skin, or I will try on other networks like DAT, ATD.
